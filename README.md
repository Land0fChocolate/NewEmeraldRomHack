# Pok√©mon Energized Emerald

Pokemon Energized Emerald is a revamp of Pokemon Emerald that offers an enhanced and expanded experience in gameplay, story, graphics and QoL whilst keeping with the themes of the original game. My changes aim to make the game more fun yet also providing a good fair challenge. It's intended to make an ultimate Pokemon Emerald experience and I've built it how I would want an ultimate Pokemon Emerald game to be. 

The biggest gameplay change in Energized Emerald is that Pokemon can now have up to 3 abilities working at once, creating more dynamic and strategic battles. Players will have to consider more mechanics bouncing about in battles than in regular Pokemon games and will also find that game balance has shifted, as many Pokemon have strongly benefitted (or not) from the multiple ability change. Some Pokemon gain abilities they didn't have before, like Gulpin who now has Corrosion, which also by the way is upgraded to now make Poison moves be super effective against Steel types! New abilities and moves have also been added to further improve on Pokemon themes and battle performance, Whismur does more damage with sound based moves with its new Volume Up ability and Gardevoir can use the new move Singularity to protect with black holes!
Outside of battles are many quality of life improvements. HMs are no longer required to teach to Pokemon to traverse obstacles, only the badge and a compatible Pokemon is required. Grinding has been significantly reduced with things like stronger vitamins, an IV buffing service, an EV maxing service, and buyable Rare Candies (for the post game), so making that perfect team takes much less time.
See the lists below for more extensive details of gameplay additions and updates.

The story has been revised with more ORAS elements, and it also continues after beating the Pokemon League with a brand new story! The overworld has been updated so players will see more bustling urban areas, more labyrinthian dungeons and also brand new areas containing Pokemon not found in the wild in vanilla Emerald which is tied to the post game story. Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza are tied to the post game story and can be encountered by following it.

The players will encounter the standard Hoenn dex in their playthrough (with some post gen evolutions like Budew and Dusknoir). Non-Hoenn Pokemon are available in the post game and organically found in entirely new areas or in cases like artificial Pokemon such as Porygon are bought.
All gen 1-3 Pokemon and their future evolutions and pre-evolutions are available in this game, for a total of 419 Pokemon. There are also 31 regional forms available, and some of them are accessible before post-game!

This is a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald using the pokeemerald-expansion decompilation project as its base: https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion.
The rom hack started in December 2021, using the version of pokeemerald-expansion at the time. Most updates to pokeemerald-expansion since then have been implemented in Energized Emerald. The game will continue to be updated to add or improve features and fix bugs.

# Post Launch TODOs

Possible future additions/changes.

- Labels for ability description and IV/EV stats in Pokemon summary screen.
- Pokedex to support regional variants.
- Pokedex to have other data as well. Moves, base stats, evolution requirements, abilities?
- Improve various art assets, mostly trainer pics.
- The berry trees of the type resist berries to have their own colours.
- Implement Zinnia's battle theme. Song is in game data, but not playing well. May be that I haven't figured out the right voicegroup or the song I chose isn't viable to use with GBA sound. Thing is, I know nothing about implementing music for the GBA. Violin sound samples have been added as well just for this song.
- Implement the multi-ability pop-up box in battles. The code is there, I just can't configure it right.
- A contest side-quest with Lisia, much like in ORAS.
- Perhaps a more interesting Tate & Liza event to get Jirachi?
- Scott giving more interesting rewards to players who get all silver/gold symbols.
- In-game resource that teaches the player braile. So that it isn't required to look out of the game to solve the braile puzzles.
- Sort out the online/wireless features. Either find out how to make them work or remove them.
- Better Game Corner games. May be a ton of work though. (Perhaps one could be a Battle Palace style battle where the Player places a bet?)
- Better Battle Frontier level scaling. Open level puts opponent Pokemon to your highest level Pokemon. Should scale all Pokemon to a certain level like the battle facilities in future gens.
- Make Origin moves use their own PP. PP reduction is done in Battle Script Commands and I currently can't think of a way to differentiate Origin moves and normal moves in `Cmd_ppreduce`. Origin moves not using their own PP is currently a "feature" until this problem can be solved.
- Add another star to the Trainer Card for completing the National Dex. Create a platinum colour scheme to go along with it.
- Named NPCs like Gym Leaders, Elite 4, Steven, etc to be possible partners in Battle Tower Multi challenge.
- A better way for Mirage Island to trigger?
- Add an Anything Goes challenge to the Battle Tower or as a new battle facility, where even Mega Evolutions and legendary Pokemon like Rayquaza are allowed.
- Obligatory beach episode.

# Known Bugs

Some of these may have been carried over from pokeemerald-expansion.

- Many switch-in abilities (like Frisk and Imposter) don‚Äôt activate when both Player Pokemon and opponent Pokemon fainted previous turn (e.g. Destiny Bond) and the Player sends out a Pokemon before the opponent sends out theirs. Solving this will probably involve having to rewrite the code that deals with switch-in abilities. This is probably the same behavior as in vanilla Pokemon Emerald, but I don't see why Trace and Intimidate are allowed to activate whilst others don't, so I'm considering this a bug.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities on the same Pokemon can have their names in the ability pop-up overwritten. (e.g. Tyranitar with Sand Stream and Unnerve). This is due to how switch-in (and other types) abilities are handled. This could be fixed by setting gLastUsedAbility during the ability battle script with the new setlastusedability command, but this freezes the game when used before calling the ability pop-up. Why? Have no fucking clue.
- Abilities that activate at the same time as other abilities can use wrong strings in the battle message.
- When Rattled is activated, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Sometimes when Truant triggers, the wrong ability is shown on the pop-up.
- Intimidate may trigger on fainted Pokemon.
- Frisk may trigger on the wrong Pokemon. Often occurs in Battle Frontier.
- Arena Trap battle message when trying to switch doesn't show the ability string.
- Damp battle message when it by powder move doesn't show the ability string.
- When a Pokemon with Volt Absorb uses Ion Deluge, it triggers Volt Absorb.
- Stench ability may activate for opponent and not user. Scenario: Weezing vs Altaria, Altaria (no King's Rock) used Ice Beam which flinched Weezing, could be a bad gBattlerAttacker assignment or similar.
- Time Traveller ability ignores False Swipe effect of leaving the user with 1 HP.
- Bug Bite/Pluck is not taking the effects of the opponent's berry.
- Spinning Body activates on every hit for multi-hit moves (e.g. Hitmontop using Triple Kick). Would rather it takes affect on only the last hit.
- Backgrounds of some moves are glitched or have black boxes. (Shadow Bone, Gunk Shot, Hurricane, Focus Blast, Aura Sphere, Burn Up, Origin Pulse)
- Cloud reflection can be seen in the long grass and trees in Route 120, as well as rocks in Crumbling Gorge.
- Jumping into long grass from ledge and moving produces incorrect grass animation.
- NPCs can change colour when picking items at BP exchange corner. Palette bug.
- Shop tiles change colour when in shop mode in Mauville sweet shop. Palette bug.
- In Contests of super rank and above, Pokemon sprites and NPC overworld sprites can get weird colours. Palette bug linked to too many NPCs on screen.
- When a Pokemon evolves by trading, an exp gain sound plays over the Pokemon's cry.
- When trading with the tradeback guy and you use a Pokemon with a different ID than your own (from in-game trade), the trade screen says you are trading with the Pokemon's previous owner.
- Wild Deoxys may not regenerate HP bar properly in battle. This is just visual, actual HP values are there. Repeatedly occurs when KOing it from 100% HP.
- Deoxys is also supposed to use a form change animation when changing forms, but it isn't working at all.
- Deoxys may also skip a form change. Repeatedly occurs with Draining Kiss.
- Origin move selection has a visual cursor bug when normal moves are selected, cursor selects 3rd or 4th move, return to main fight menu and then choose Origin move.
- Some Pokemon in PC boxes have the top left corner of their front sprite snipped off. (Dodrio, Alakazam, Kyogre, Lanturn, Aerodactyl, Flygon, Salamence and more)
- Move relearner doesn't list all of the possible moves to relearn, only the first ~15.

# Frequently Asked Questions/Troubleshooting

- The ROM doesn't patch
There are other downloads on the Pokemon Energized Emerald Discord server to try. Make sure you're using a Trashman Pokemon Emerald ROM. 

- The game crashes during the introduction
This is an emulator issue and I don't know why this happens. Try a different core on your emulator or a different emulator. I've had success with mBGA, Virtual Boy Advance and Pizza Boy on Android.

- How do I put the game onto a cartridge?
I have absolutely no idea. I don't even know if it's possible for pokeemeerald-expansion projects. 

- Cheats don't work!
Yeah, not surprising. The format of the save file has been changed. Don't ask me to make cheats because I will not make them.

- Is there any documentation?
Yes. There are doc files included with the ROM download. 

- I'm stuck in the post game!
There's a post game story guide in the docs. I've tried to make it obvious to tell players where to go but I will keep trying to improve it.

- Will you add in more Pokemon?
Nope. I feel 450 different species is enough and I don't want the game to get bogged down with bloat.

- Will you make Mega Evolutions accessible earlier?
Nope. The game is not designed for them in terms of difficulty curves and story themes. Besides, I feel like they don't add that much gameplay complexity to justify their inclusion and they can distract players from using new features like the multi ability system. 

- Will you increase Pokemon Storage Box size?
Nope. I can't increase the Storage Box size any more due to GBA limitations. I feel 450 spaces is just enough and can work for a living dex anyway.
